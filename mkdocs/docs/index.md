# Welcome to The Herd Scripting Reference

This documentation collects the scripting API that powers The Herd. To make the most of it you should already be familiar with Unity scripting workflows and conventions.

The reference is organised by the classes, interfaces, and ScriptableObjects exposed to gameplay code. Each page lists the intent of the type, where it lives in the project, and the members you interact with most often.

Examples accompany a handful of the entries to highlight typical usage patterns.
